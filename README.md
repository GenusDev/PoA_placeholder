Genie Portal is a transparent platform for managing tokenized securities and smart contracts for Genus Development Partners, a property and business developer.

Users can input their email and choose why they are interested in the platform. They will be notified with updates and/or launches of the official Genie Portal.

The platform is outfitted with spatial analytical overlays and a means of transferring and purchasing tokens. The intention is to use this project as a prototype that can be shown and then adapted for other developers interested in having portals to facilitate the financing of their projects. The platform will also provide a means for managing equity in the parent company and sub projects.
